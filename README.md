# Smart-Walking-Stick-for-Visually-Impaired-Person
This is a complete hardware and software development of a Smart Walking Stick which consists of two main components:
  1. An ultrasonic sensor that can help detect an obstacle in a 2-3 meter range and give a buzzer to the person to alert him.
  2. A camera is used to capture a photo(name written on the shopboards/any directions written on the road) which can help pronounce the text captured in it through a speaker connected to the Raspberry board as illustrated below.
